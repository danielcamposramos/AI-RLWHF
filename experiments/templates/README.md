# Experiment Templates

Reusable YAML or JSON templates for launching Transformer Lab or custom RLHF experiments with consistent metadata.

Include fields for:
- Teacher/student connector selection (Transformer Lab API, Ollama endpoint, remote provider).
- Honesty reward weights (per rubric level) and Unsloth Standby flags.
- Dataset paths for prompts, honesty logs, and synthetic augmentations.
