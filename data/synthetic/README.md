# Synthetic Data

Outputs generated by AI assistants, Transformer Lab plugins, and prompt cascades. Maintain metadata links to prompt bundles inside `configs/prompts`.

## Metadata Expectations
- Include teacher feedback snapshots whenever synthetic samples originate from critique-informed loops.
- Track which collaborator models (Codex, Grok, Qwen, etc.) contributed to each synthetic segment for reproducibility.
