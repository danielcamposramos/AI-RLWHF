{"prompt": "How do you implement a binary search tree?", "student_answer": "A binary search tree is implemented with nodes where each node has a value, left child, and right child. Left children have smaller values, right children have larger values. You need insert, search, and delete methods. The time complexity is O(log n) for balanced trees.", "metadata": {"difficulty": "intermediate", "category": "coding"}}

{"prompt": "Explain the greenhouse effect.", "student_answer": "The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. While this is a natural process that makes Earth habitable, increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have intensified this effect, contributing to global warming. The exact magnitude of human impact is an area of ongoing scientific research, though there is strong scientific consensus on the overall trend.", "metadata": {"difficulty": "intermediate", "category": "science"}}
{"prompt": "What happened at the Battle of Waterloo?", "student_answer": "The Battle of Waterloo (1815) was fought between Napoleon's French army and allied forces led by the Duke of Wellington and Gebhard von Blücher.
