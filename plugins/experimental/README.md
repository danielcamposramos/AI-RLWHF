# Experimental Plugins

Sandbox for exploratory or speculative plugin ideas. Promote successful variants into `plugins/core`.

Focus areas:
- Prototype direct Ollama or custom inference connectors without waiting for upstream Transformer Lab support.
- Trial novel reward strategies (multi teacher consensus, reinforcement gating, memory dashboards).
- Validate hybrid setups mixing Unsloth Standby runners with Transformer Lab orchestration.
