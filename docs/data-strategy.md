# Data Strategy

- Acquisition: Catalogue user owned documents, open source corpora, and real time knowledge feeds.
- Normalization: Apply consistent tokenization, segmentation, and annotation via `scripts/data_pipeline`.
- Feedback Capture: Attach honesty, alignment, and human preference metadata to each sample. Persist teacher critiques and rubric scores for transparent RLWHF loops.
- Governance: Track licensing and usage constraints inside dataset manifests.
