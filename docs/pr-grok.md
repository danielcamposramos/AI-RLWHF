# PR: Seed RLWHF Framework Documentation and Scaffolding

## Summary
- Establish comprehensive documentation for teacher-student RLWHF loops, memory-efficient Unsloth Standby guidance, and connector modularity.
- Expand README and directory-level guides with rubric-aware workflows, prompt registry plans, and plugin evolution goals.
- Update planning artifacts to align with Multi Vibe Coding In Chain collaboration and Transformer Lab plugin strategy.

## Testing
- Documentation only; no runtime changes executed yet.

## Next Steps
- Implement prompt loaders and rubric definitions under `configs/prompts/`.
- Prototype teacher evaluator plugin using `tlab_trainer` and shared connectors.
- Capture memory telemetry comparisons between baseline and Unsloth Standby GRPO runs.
