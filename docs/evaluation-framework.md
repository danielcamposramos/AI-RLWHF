# Evaluation Framework

1. Quality Metrics: BLEU, ROUGE, factual consistency, narrative coherence.
2. Honesty Metrics: Truthfulness prompts, contradiction detection, calibration scoring. Use the -2 to +2 rubric captured in `docs/rlwhf-framework.md` for teacher-student scoring.
3. Feedback Integration: RLHF reward modeling, annotated critique loops, reviewer consensus tagging.
4. Reporting: Markdown digests, JSONL logs, and optional dashboard exports.
