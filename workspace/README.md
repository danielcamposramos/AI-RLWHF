# Workspace

Shared notebooks, ad hoc research drafts, and collaborative scratchpads for Multi Vibe Coding sessions.

Guidelines:
- Capture teacher-student prompt experiments and annotate reward observations before formalizing them inside `docs/`.
- Mirror chain-of-model updates (Codex, Grok, Kimi K2, GLM 4.6, DeepSeek, Qwen) to preserve the Multi Vibe Coding message board history.
- Export finalized insights into `docs/rlwhf-framework.md` or `experiments/templates` as patterns stabilize.
