# Shared Workspace

Synchronized assets exchanged between collaborators during workshops or live debugging.

- Use for transient artifacts such as prompt drafts, scoreboard exports, or screenshot evidence from Transformer Lab runs.
- Clean or promote artifacts to persistent directories (e.g., `docs/`, `configs/`) once validated.
