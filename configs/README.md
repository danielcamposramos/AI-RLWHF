# Configuration Hub

Version controlled configuration bundles for Transformer Lab, data processing, experiments, and prompt presets.

## Highlights
- `prompts/`: Teacher/student prompt packs and honesty rubrics.
- `transformer-lab/`: Profiles for plugin installation, connector endpoints, and dataset registration.
- `training/`: Feature toggles (`feature_toggles.json`, `unsloth_standby.json`) shared across scripts, plugins, and UI presets.
