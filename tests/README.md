# Tests

Unit, integration, and behavioral validation suites for plugins, pipelines, and model harnesses.

## Targets
- Validate that teacher evaluator plugins emit the -2…+2 rubric correctly for golden examples.
- Provide regression tests ensuring connector factories (Transformer Lab, Ollama, remote APIs) share prompt packs consistently.
- Cover data pipeline utilities that serialize honesty tuples and reward aggregates.
