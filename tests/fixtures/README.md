# Test Fixtures

Minimal sample payloads reused across automated tests. Keep fixtures anonymized and small.

Recommended fixtures:
- Teacher/student exchange sets showcasing each reward bucket (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2).
- Prompt registry stubs mirroring `configs/prompts/teacher` for reproducible tests.
- Memory telemetry snapshots for validating Unsloth Standby instrumentation.
